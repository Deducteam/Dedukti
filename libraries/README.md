# Libraries
A collection of hand-written files for Dedukti

Description of the directories:

- **theories** contains theory files written in Dedukti. A theory file is used to type check other Dedukti files encoded in this theory. Usually, these files are generated by one of our [generators](https://github.com/Deducteam/Libraries/tree/master/theories/README.md).
- **paradoxes** contains several paradoxes of theories encoded in Dedukti.
