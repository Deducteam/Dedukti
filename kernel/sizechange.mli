(** A call [{callee; caller; matrix; is_rec}] represents a call to the
    function symbol with key [callee] by the function symbole with the
    key [caller]. The [matrix] gives the relation between the parameters
    of the caller and the callee. The coefficient [matrix.(a).(b)] give
    the relation between the [a]-th parameter of the caller and the
    [b]-th argument of the callee. The boolean [is_rec] is true when the
    call is a reccursive call (i.e. a call to a generalised hypothesis
    lower in the tree. It is [false] for every call to subtyping in the
    typing algorithm and the same goes for rules introducing a new
    induction hypothesis. Every other call refers to a previously
    introduced induction hypothesis and its boolean is [true]. *)
